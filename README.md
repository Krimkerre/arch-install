Basic Arch install script.

Original script by Erik Sundquist

I basically took his base.sh script, and modded it for my own purposes

****** WARNING *****
If you run the install script it will completely format your drive defined in the base.sh file.  Please edit that file and be careful to know what you are doing or have that drive you want to install to installed only.

Boot from Arch ISO
pacman -Sy
pacman -S git

git clone https://github.com/Krimkerre/arch-install.git
Type: chmod +x *.sh

Follow instructions, when completed reboot.
